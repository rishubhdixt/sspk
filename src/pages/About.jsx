          <p className="text-base">
            Founded in 2010 by Rekha Dixit, <strong>Saraswati Shikshan Evam Prashikshan Kendra</strong> began with a simple yet powerful mission: to empower individuals through education, skill development, and long-term vision. What started as a grassroots initiative with limited resources has evolved into a recognized force in youth development and social impact across Uttar Pradesh.

          </div>

          <p className="text-base">
            In the early years, the focus was on spreading awareness about basic education in underserved communities. Through consistent outreach and unwavering commitment, the NGO established its first training center in 2012, offering courses in tailoring, computer literacy, and soft skills. These efforts gradually gained momentum as local trust and participation grew.

            The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 tested our resilience. Instead of halting operations, we pivotedâ€”conducting online classes, distributing essential supplies, and offering mental health support. Our commitment during crisis earned us recognition and deeper community ties.

          <p className="text-base">
            Post-pandemic, we expanded into government-recognized programs like <strong>PMKVY</strong>, <strong>UPSDM</strong>, and <strong>DDU-GKY</strong>, training thousands of youth with industry-relevant skills. Today, under the visionary leadership of Rekha Dixit, we continue to evolveâ€”building future-ready citizens, embracing technology, and setting new benchmarks in social development.
